# Learn Mission Artwork Prompts

The following image slots are referenced by the Learn hub mission setup and briefing scenes. Add matching assets under `public/` using the prompts below to keep the playful, game-like aesthetic consistent.

| Image path | Prompt direction |
| --- | --- |
| `public/img/learn/missions/full-flight-config.jpg` | *"Cinematic futuristic flight planning table, neon holographic airport map with glowing dice and mission briefing cards, dark cockpit ambience, ultra-wide concept art, volumetric lighting, vibrant cyan and magenta accents, high-detail digital painting."* |
| `public/img/learn/missions/full-flight-brief.jpg` | *"Stylised mission control screen showing departure and arrival airports connected by glowing route, pilot call sign badge floating, cyberpunk HUD overlays, deep blue night sky, energetic particles, dramatic lighting, AAA game concept art style."* |

> Tip: keep contrasts strong so overlaid text remains readable, and lean into sci-fi cockpit UI motifs to reinforce the training game's feel.
