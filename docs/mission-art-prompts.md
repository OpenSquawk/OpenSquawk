# Mission Art Prompts

The mission setup and briefing flow expects cinematic imagery to reinforce the "training sim" atmosphere. Provide artwork for the following placeholder paths:

| Image path | Prompt suggestion |
| --- | --- |
| `/img/learn/missions/setup-hud.jpg` | "Futuristic airliner cockpit planning bay, glowing holographic HUD with route overlays, teal and cyan lighting, pilot silhouette reviewing mission dossier, ultra-wide shot, high contrast, volumetric light beams, concept art style" |
| `/img/learn/missions/briefing-deck.jpg` | "Airline operations center at night, controllers around illuminated desks, massive wall of flight trackers and holographic maps, cinematic lighting, cyberpunk tones, sense of anticipation before departure" |
| `/img/learn/missions/briefing-flightdeck.jpg` | "Commercial jet flight deck ready for pushback, cockpit lights glowing amber and blue, runway visible through windshield at dusk, dynamic perspective, game concept art, high detail" |

Feel free to tweak the prompts to match the house art style, but keep the vibe energetic and game-like.
